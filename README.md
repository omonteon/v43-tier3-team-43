### Built with

- NextJS
- TailwindCSS
- WebRTC
- Firebase

### What we learned

This project helped us collaborate in a team and learn new technologies. Most of the stack was new to us, and the challenge to use WebRTC was a great learning experience since most of the team has a frontend background. 

### Continued development

We would like to improve the following areas:
- Add support for mobile.
- Improve call id interaction.
- Add authentication.
- Support more cases and add unit/integration tests.

### Useful resources

- [WebRTC Codelab](https://webrtc.org/getting-started/firebase-rtc-codelab) - This helped us understand how to use WebRTC.
